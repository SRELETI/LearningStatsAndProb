# Descriptive Statistics

Mean:

For a list of n values, mean is the sum of values divided by number of values. It is used to describe the central tendency.

The mean is a good description of a list of values in some cases. For example, when comparing apples which are almost of same sizes. But when comparing values which are more diverse, it may not be a good option.



Variance:

If mean alone is not a good descriptor of a list of values, then we can do better job with both Mean and Variance. Mean is used to describe the spread. 



$$variance = 1/n $$ âˆ‘ \(x-mean\)2



x-mean is deviation from the mean. So, variance is the mean squared deviation. 

Variance is mean squared deviation because of couple of reasons:



1. Squaring makes each term positive so that values above the mean do not cancel values below the mean 
2. Squaring adds more weight to the larger differences and in many cases this extra weighting is appropriate since points further from the mean may be more significant.



Standard Deviation:

Standard deviation is the square root of the variance. Because, the differences are squared, the units of variance are not the same as the units of data. Therefore, the standard deviation is reported as square root of the variance and the units then correspond to those of the data set.



The Calculation of variance and standard deviation depends on the whether we are considering entire population or a sample set.  



For sample set, we divided the mean squared deviation with number of elements-1 to get sample variance.
